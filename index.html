        This Boolean attribute is set to indicate to a browser that the script is meant to be executed
        after the document has been parsed, but before firing DOMContentLoaded.
        Scripts with the defer attribute will prevent the DOMContentLoaded event from firing
        until the script has loaded and finished evaluating.   -->
